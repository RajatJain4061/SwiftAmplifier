# SwiftAmplifier
Amplify your swift programming with powerful extensions

## Objective
To ease developers to extend the power of swift and prevent my fellow developers to reinvent the wheel. This will save your lot of time in development. I only add those extensions which I need during my development instead of copying usless extensions from the internet. If you have any extensions then you can also add your extension in this library by creating a pull request.

## Comming up next
We will maintain the project with all latest swift versions and most advanced code styles. Code documentation is going to be covered as well.

Also, unit tests will be added to ensure the quality of the extensions.
